# EMR Local Container

## Getting Started

Thanks for installing your local EMR environment. To get started, there are a few steps.

- Update .devcontainer/aws.env with your AWS credentials.
- Login to ECR with the following command:

        aws ecr get-login-password --region ap-south-1 \
        | docker login \
            --username AWS \
            --password-stdin \
            235914868574.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com

- Use the `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container` command to build your new environment.

## Usage tips

- You can start a new shell with the `pyspark` command in a terminal.
    - If you've configured your AWS credentials in `.env`, you should have access to everything you need.
- A sample PySpark script has been created for you in the `emr_tools_demo.py` file.
